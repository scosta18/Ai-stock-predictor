Frontend: React (for UI and charts)

Backend: FastAPI (to serve data and logic)

ML: Basic time series prediction (e.g. linear regression or simple moving average)

AI: Gemini API (to provide reasoning/explanation)

✅ Project Architecture Overview
🔹 React Frontend
Fetches stock data and predictions from FastAPI

Shows:

Past stock data (with a chart, e.g. Chart.js or Recharts)

Predicted data for next 7 days

Gemini-generated reasoning

UI elements: date picker, stock symbol input, loading indicator, prediction display

🔹 FastAPI Backend
/api/stock/{symbol} → returns historical stock data

/api/predict/{symbol} → returns next 7-day prediction

/api/reasoning/{symbol} → calls Gemini API for insights

🔹 ML Logic
Use pandas and scikit-learn

Models: Linear Regression or basic time series smoothing

Store/cache fetched data locally (e.g. using yfinance)

🔹 Gemini Integration
Gemini API call from FastAPI backend (send last N days’ data + model output)

Output: “The stock is likely to rise due to XYZ…”

🧠 Development Phases (within a few days)
Day 1: FastAPI Backend + Stock Data Fetching
Use yfinance or Alpha Vantage to pull historical stock data

Set up FastAPI with basic routes (/stock, /predict)

Day 2: ML Prediction Logic
Use LinearRegression from sklearn for 7-day extrapolation

Return JSON predictions for frontend

Day 3: React Frontend
Use Axios to hit API

Display charts (Chart.js or Recharts)

Show predictions and reasoning

Day 4: Gemini API Integration
Write a function that takes data summary and hits Gemini

Add reasoning section below prediction
